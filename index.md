# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
My first milestone was setting up my moisture sensor. In order to do this I needed to attach my sensor to an Arduino MKR. I had to download new wifi and bluetooth libraries for the Arduino so it could connect to the app later. After that I attached the soldering pins and connected the sensor. I then tested it changing how frequently it collected data to get more accurate reads.
